# MuroSync - Technical Notes

This site documents practical research and engineering work on optical timing
and synchronization systems, with a focus on:

- delay compensation in optical links
- phase alignment techniques in FPGA-based designs
- practical measurement limitations and trade-offs
- integration into scientific control systems

These notes reflect ongoing engineering work related to the **MuroSync** project.
They are not product documentation, but technical design and research notes.
